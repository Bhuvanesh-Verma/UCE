UCE already supports a collection of ontologies developed across various projects. These ontologies are fully supported **out of the box**, requiring no additional development within UCE to be functional.

We are continuously working to expand this listâ€”similar to our efforts with compatible annotations. If you would like to contribute an ontology, you are welcome to submit a pull request or [contact us](#TODO) directly.

*All ontologies must be in RDF or OWL format.*
